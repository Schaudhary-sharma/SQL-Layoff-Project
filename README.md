Case Study: "Who Got Fired?" â€” Layoff Analysis (2020 to March 2023)\
"Who Got Fired?" â€” SQL Layoff Analysis
This case study dives into real-world tech layoffs from 2020 to March 2023. Through a series of SQL queries, we uncovered:
â€¢	Layoff patterns by year, industry, and company
â€¢	Total shutdowns (100% layoffs)
â€¢	Impact of funding on layoff resilience
â€¢	Top affected countries and company stages

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Objective: Analyze layoff trends from 2020 to March 2023 to uncover industry patterns, company shutdowns, and the impact of funding on survival.
Business Use Case:
â€¢	Understand macroeconomic impacts on employment
â€¢	Identify vulnerable industries during crises
â€¢	Predict signals of business shutdowns
â€¢	Help job seekers and HR professionals assess market risks
Tools Used: SQL, PostgreSQL / MySQL, Excel (for cleaning), Tableau / Power BI (optional for visualization)

ðŸ§µ Project Story â€” From Chaos to Clarity
The global economy went through a hiring frenzy in 2020... but what came next was unexpected. Mass layoffs shook the tech world from 2020 to 2023. Weâ€™ve heard the headlines, but the real question is:
What really happened â€” and what can we learn from it?
I rolled up my sleeves, wrote some SQL, and built a story out of numbers. Here's what I found...

ðŸ§  Key Business Questions & Insights
Q1: Which year had the highest number of layoffs?
SELECT YEAR(date) AS Year, SUM(total_laid_off) AS Total_Laid_Off
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY YEAR(date)
ORDER BY Total_Laid_Off DESC;

Insight: 2023 (till March) had the highest layoffs, showing that the trend didnâ€™t slow post-COVID â€” it escalated.


Q2: What industries were most affected?
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off) AS Total_Laid_Off
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY Total_Laid_Off DESC;

Insight: The tech industry was the most affected, especially sectors like Consumer, Retail, and Crypto.

Q3: Which companies had the highest layoffs?
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) AS Total_Laid_Off
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY Total_Laid_Off DESC
LIMIT 10;

Insight: Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft were among the top â€” proving even the biggest players werenâ€™t immune.

Q4: Which companies shut down completely?
SELECT company, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off
FROM layoffs
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1;

Insight: Companies like Katerra, Quibi, and Britishvolt laid off 100% of their staff â€” signaling complete shutdown.


Q5: How does funding relate to layoffs? (Did billion-dollar companies fail?)
SELECT company, total_laid_off, funds_raised, percentage_laid_off
FROM layoffs
WHERE funds_raised > 1000000000
ORDER BY percentage_laid_off DESC;

Insight: Shockingly, even companies that raised billions werenâ€™t safe. Britishvolt raised $2.4B yet laid off everyone.

Q6: Which countries had the highest layoffs?
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off) AS Total_Laid_Off
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY Total_Laid_Off DESC;

Insight: The U.S. led the world in layoffs, reaffirming it as the epicenter of tech job volatility.

Q7: Were smaller or bigger companies laying off more?
SELECT company, stage, SUM(total_laid_off) AS Total_Laid_Off
FROM layoffs
GROUP BY company, stage
ORDER BY Total_Laid_Off DESC;

Insight: Both early-stage and late-stage companies faced layoffs. Unicorns and IPO-stage companies werenâ€™t protected.



ðŸ§  What Can We Learn From This?
ðŸ”„ Strategic Takeaways:
â€¢	Mass layoffs werenâ€™t isolated to 2020 â€” it was a prolonged trend.
â€¢	Funding doesnâ€™t equal safety â€” execution and adaptability matter more.
â€¢	Shutdown patterns can be predicted by monitoring % of layoffs.
ðŸ”® For Job Seekers & Professionals:
â€¢	Evaluate industry health before career moves.
â€¢	Donâ€™t assume size or funding = job security.
â€¢	Use public layoff data to assess risk.

ðŸŒŸ Final Thought
This isnâ€™t just a data project. Itâ€™s a story of survival, mistakes, and market shifts â€” all hidden in rows and columns.
And the best part? You can learn from it, with just a few SQL queries.
