# SQL-Layoff-Project
Case Study: "Who Got Fired?" â€” Layoff Analysis (2020 to March 2023)

This case study dives into real-world tech layoffs from 2020 to March 2023. Through a series of SQL queries, we uncovered:
â€¢	Layoff patterns by year, industry, and company
â€¢	Total shutdowns (100% layoffs)
â€¢	Impact of funding on layoff resilience
â€¢	Top affected countries and company stages

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Objective: Analyze layoff trends from 2020 to March 2023 to uncover industry patterns, company shutdowns, and the impact of funding on survival.
Business Use Case:
â€¢	Understand macroeconomic impacts on employment
â€¢	Identify vulnerable industries during crises
â€¢	Predict signals of business shutdowns
â€¢	Help job seekers and HR professionals assess market risks
Tools Used: SQL, PostgreSQL / MySQL, Excel (for cleaning), Tableau / Power BI (optional for visualization)
Dataset Source: Attached in File section with name "Layoffs Dataset"

ðŸ§µ Project Story â€” From Chaos to Clarity
The global economy went through a hiring frenzy in 2020... but what came next was unexpected. Mass layoffs shook the tech world from 2020 to 2023. Weâ€™ve heard the headlines, but the real question is:
What really happened â€” and what can we learn from it?
I rolled up my sleeves, wrote some SQL, and built a story out of numbers. Here's what I found...

ðŸ§  What Can We Learn From This?
ðŸ”„ Strategic Takeaways:
â€¢	Mass layoffs werenâ€™t isolated to 2020 â€” it was a prolonged trend.
â€¢	Funding doesnâ€™t equal safety â€” execution and adaptability matter more.
â€¢	Shutdown patterns can be predicted by monitoring % of layoffs.
ðŸ”® For Job Seekers & Professionals:
â€¢	Evaluate industry health before career moves.
â€¢	Donâ€™t assume size or funding = job security.
â€¢	Use public layoff data to assess risk.

ðŸŒŸ Final Thought
This isnâ€™t just a data project. Itâ€™s a story of survival, mistakes, and market shifts â€” all hidden in rows and columns.
And the best part? You can learn from it, with just a few SQL queries.
