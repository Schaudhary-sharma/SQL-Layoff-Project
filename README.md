# SQL-Layoff-Project
Case Study: "Who Got Fired?" — Layoff Analysis (2020 to March 2023)

This case study dives into real-world tech layoffs from 2020 to March 2023. Through a series of SQL queries, we uncovered:
•	Layoff patterns by year, industry, and company
•	Total shutdowns (100% layoffs)
•	Impact of funding on layoff resilience
•	Top affected countries and company stages

Project Overview
Objective: Analyze layoff trends from 2020 to March 2023 to uncover industry patterns, company shutdowns, and the impact of funding on survival.
Business Use Case:
•	Understand macroeconomic impacts on employment
•	Identify vulnerable industries during crises
•	Predict signals of business shutdowns
•	Help job seekers and HR professionals assess market risks
Tools Used: SQL, PostgreSQL / MySQL, Excel (for cleaning), Tableau / Power BI (optional for visualization)
Dataset Source: Attached in File section with name "Layoffs Dataset"

Project Story — From Chaos to Clarity
The global economy went through a hiring frenzy in 2020... but what came next was unexpected. Mass layoffs shook the tech world from 2020 to 2023. We’ve heard the headlines, but the real question is:
What really happened — and what can we learn from it?
I rolled up my sleeves, wrote some SQL, and built a story out of numbers. Here's what I found...

What Can We Learn From This?
Strategic Takeaways:
•	Mass layoffs weren’t isolated to 2020 — it was a prolonged trend.
•	Funding doesn’t equal safety — execution and adaptability matter more.
•	Shutdown patterns can be predicted by monitoring % of layoffs.
For Job Seekers & Professionals:
•	Evaluate industry health before career moves.
•	Don’t assume size or funding = job security.
•	Use public layoff data to assess risk.

Final Thought
This isn’t just a data project. It’s a story of survival, mistakes, and market shifts — all hidden in rows and columns.
And the best part? You can learn from it, with just a few SQL queries.
